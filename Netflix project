# Investigating Netflix Movies

# Explore Netflix movie data and perform exploratory data analysis for a production company to uncover insights about movies from a particular decade.

# Start with importing the relevant packages
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read in the Netflix CSV file as a DataFrame and store it as Netflix_df
Netflix_df = pd.read_csv("/Users/usamasuleiman/Downloads/workspace/data/netflix_dataset.csv")

# Task A: What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s? Save an approximate answer as an integer called duration.

# Start by filtering for the 1990's. that means from 1990-1999.
movies_90s = Netflix_df[(Netflix_df["release_year"] >= 1990) & (Netflix_df["release_year"] < 2000)]

# Clean the duration column and convert the strings to integers
def clean_duration(duration):
    try:
        return int(duration.replace(' min', ''))
    except:
        return None

# Apply the cleaning function to the 'duration' column
movies_90s['duration'] = movies_90s['duration'].apply(clean_duration)

# Check the cleaned duration column
print(movies_90s['duration'].head())

# Plot the histogram of movie durations in the 1990s
plt.hist(movies_90s["duration"].dropna(), bins=20, color='blue', edgecolor='black')  # Drop NaN values for histogram
plt.title("Distribution of Movie Durations in the 1990s")
plt.xlabel("Duration (minutes)")
plt.ylabel("Number of Movies")
plt.show()

# Task B: A movie is considered short if it is less than 90 minutes.
# Count the number of short action movies released in the 1990s and save this integer as short_movie_count.

# Filter the data for Action movies
action_movies_1990s = movies_90s[movies_90s["type"] == "Action"]

# Count the number of short action movies
short_movie_count = action_movies_1990s[action_movies_1990s['duration'] < 90].shape[0]

print("Number of short action movies in the 1990s:", short_movie_count)
